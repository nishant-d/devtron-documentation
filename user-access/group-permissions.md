# Group permissions

### Groups

The advantage of the groups is to define a set of privileges like create, edit, or delete for the given set of resources that can be shared among the users within the group. Users can be added to an existing group to utilize the privileges that it grants. You can select the group which you are creating in the `Group permissions` section inside `Add users`.

#### 1. Add new Group

#### 2. Create Group Permissions

Once you have given the group name and group description.

Then, control the access permissions of groups in the Direct Permissions section. Manage the Project, Environment, Application, and Role access the same as we discuss in the above users section.
