The ConfigMap API resource holds key-value pairs of configuration data that can be consumed in pods or used to store configuration data for system components such as controllers. ConfigMap is similar to Secrets, but designed to more conveniently support working with strings that do not contain sensitive information.

Click on `Add ConfigMap` to add a config map to your application.

`Key` | Key.
`Value` | Value for a given key.

<br />

You can Click on "YAML" or "GUI" to view the key and Value parameters of the ConfigMap that you have created.

### Volume Mount Path

Specify Volume Mount folder path in `Volume Mount Path`, path where the data volume needs to be mounted, which will be accessible to the Containers running in a pod.

Click `Save ConfigMap` to save the configMap.

### Kubernetes External ConfigMap

Kubernetes External ConfigMap is created using `kubectl create configmap` or you can use ConfigMap generator in kustomization.yaml to create a ConfigMap.

If you are using Kubernetes External ConfigMap make sure you give the name of ConfigMap same as the name that you have given using `kubectl create Configmap <configmap-name> <data source>` command, otherwise it might result in error during the built.

You have to ensure that the External ConfigMap exists and is made available to the pod.
