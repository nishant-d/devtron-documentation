## Automated Test suite integration in CI step using devtron-ci.yaml

User can run the Test case using the Devtron Dashboard `or` by including the Test cases in `devtron.ci.yaml` file in the source git repository. For reference, check: [https://github.com/kumarnishant/getting-started-nodejs/blob/master/devtron-ci.yaml](https://github.com/kumarnishant/getting-started-nodejs/blob/master/devtron-ci.yaml)

The test cases given in the script will run before the Test Cases given in the  `devtron.ci.yaml`

Field | Description
------|------------ 
`version`   | specify the version of yaml
`appliesTo` | applies the changes to a specified branch 
`type`      | branch type on which changes are to be applied, it can be BRANCH_FIXED or TAG_PATTERN 
`value`     | branch name on which changes are to be applied, it can take a value as name of branch ("master") or as a regular expression ("%d.%d.%d-rc")
`script`    | script which you want to execute, you can also execute the docker commands here
`beforeDockerBuildStages` | script to run before the docker build step
`afterDockerBuildStages`  | script to run after the docker build step
`outputLocation`          | location where you want to see the output of report of Test cases

## External CI Pipeline

You can use Devtron for Deployments on Kubernetes while still using your own CI tool such as Jenkins. External CI feature can be used for such cases where 
the CI tool is hosted outside Devtron architecture.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

![Create CI Pipeline](./external_pipeline.jpg "External CI Pipeline")

&nbsp;&nbsp;

You can send the 'Payload script' to your CI tool such as Jenkins and `Devtron` will receive the build image everytime the CI Service is triggered or
you can you use the `Webhook URL` which will build image everytime CI Service is triggered using `Devtron` Dashboard. 

<br />

<br />

Key | Description
-----|-----
`Pipeline Name` | Name of the pipeline
`Source Type`   | 'Branch Fixed' or 'Tag Regex'
`Branch Name` | Name of the branch

<br>


## Linked CI Pipeline

If one code is shared across multiple applications Linked CI Pipeline can be used, and only one image will be build for multiple applications because
if there is only one build, it is not advisable to create multiple CI Pipelines.
